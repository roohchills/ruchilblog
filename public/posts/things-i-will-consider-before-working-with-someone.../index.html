    <meta name="twitter:description" content="A short piece  on things that I will consider before working with a company or a group of individuals going forward. There are a number of additonal considerations which I&rsquo;ll try to add later to this post. You may find this helpful.

Leadership Quality:
When joining a company, carefully evaluate the authenticity of leadership. Many founders are driven by wealth, status, need to earn respect,  or personal gain rather than genuine mission. While these motivations aren&rsquo;t  wrong, ensure they align with your values. Ser Elon creates markets through conviction, but yeah, such leaders are rare.



Growth Potential:
There are about 400 million companies globally. Be selective about your environment. Avoid toxic founders who run away from accountability and mistreat others. Their treatment of close associates often reveals their true character. Pay attention to patterns of blame-shifting and how they handle difficult questions.



Balancing Risk Reward:
Time and energy are your most finite resources - more valuable than monetary compensation. Don&rsquo;t let high salary blind you to red flags about toxic environments. Choose energizing workplaces with competent leadership over higher-paying but demoralizing situations. I would personally prefer working  with talented, well-intentioned colleagues over working with self-proclaimed, narcissistic leaders



Intentionality:
Match opportunities to your current priorities. Keep your identity small to avoid over-attachment to any role. If financial stability is your goal, consider big tech or well-funded startups. For rapid learning, early-stage startups or VC funds might be more suitable. Above all, prioritize working with trustworthy colleagues who energize rather than drain you.



It‚Äôs Okay to Leave Early:
Treat the initial period as mutual evaluation. Despite the current employer-favored dynamic, don&rsquo;t hesitate to leave toxic companies early. While a formal 14-day trial period would be ideal, use your early days to assess the environment&rsquo;s compatibility with your goals and values. Your potential growth in the next 6-12 months is more valuable than enduring a poor fit.
