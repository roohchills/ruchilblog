      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, we’ve been accustomed to text-based Q&amp;amp;As and black-box answers. While the use cases are numerous, I think the next wave will be dominated by image and video generation, if not already, similar to TikTok and YouTube Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT could end up like Twitter/X: a place for the most insightful questions and answers, but with distribution largely controlled by players such as Google and MidJourney, where most users create and consume &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop&#34;&gt;AI slop&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been long on Google for a while and remain bullish on midwit AI usecases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend and I have started building AI products on the weekends to get used to the latest AI tools and their capabilities. Even though we’re just a few weeks into this (while also managing our day jobs), I’m really impressed by how advanced these tools are. Back in 2019, I dreamed of building products on my own, without relying on developers. Thanks to ser Musk and Altman, that dream is now a reality. I no longer need developers or even designers to launch the first version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently tried out the Perplexity app and was quite impressed with the results. While I’ve not spent enough time to come to a conclusion yet, what really delighted me was the time it took to answer my question. Searching through Perplextiy felt like speaking to a friend who knows what exactly you are looking for and spoon feeding the response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I searched for &lt;em&gt;how should I select an uploaded image on Notability&lt;/em&gt; inside Perplexity &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt;. Without clicking a single link, Perplexity walked me through the image selection process whereas Google showed an answer to a different question altogether. Perplexity not only understood this simple question correctly, it shared a step by step process to resolve my query instead of an incorrect response as a summary. See screenshots below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
