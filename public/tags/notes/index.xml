      <description>I will take that bet.
You buy 1 BTC.
I will send $1M USD.
This is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k.
The term is 90 days.
All we need is a mutually agreed custodian who will still be there to settle this in the event of digital dollar devaluation.
If someone knows how to do this‚Ä¶ https://t.co/hhPr522PQu pic.twitter.com/6Aav9KeJpe
&amp;mdash; Balaji (@balajis) March 17, 2023 Having reviewed this tweet&amp;rsquo;s contents in detail, I find Balaji&amp;rsquo;s argument about inflation being a significant threat to the American economy quite persuasive.</description>

      <description>After 4 years, I have started using Social Media platforms again. While I had no difficulties posting (except stories on Instagram), there are certain observations and patterns that I have started to come across different social media platforms. Detailing them out here :
1.Twitter Tagline from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective : I am smart and &amp;ldquo;intellectual&amp;rdquo; as well. Please koi meri bhi sun lo. From replying on Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s and Balajis Tweets to posting random threads on why you should switch to Signal, Twitter is an echo - chamber of wanna be &amp;ldquo;intellectuals&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Strong Opinions Loosely Held</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Strong opinions, weakly held&amp;rdquo; is one of the frameworks used to deal with an uncertain future and yet, still move forward. It is one of the tools to become aware and have the courage to act on your knowledge, but also have the humility to doubt what we know. It is a framework that I use to prevent myself from seeing and hearing only the things that I like and discard others.</description>

      <title>Everything is a Product</title>

      <description>This realisation came to me after reading the biographies of Michael Jordan and Leonardo Da Vinci. Some of the VCs and Product Folks in Silicon Valley also subscribe to this thought. They treat themselves and their careers as that of professional athletes. According to them, the way you conduct yourself, the way you eat, your personal journal or as a matter of fact, your fingernails are nothing but mini - products.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve stayed in Delhi - NCR for ~ 1.5 years now (since September 2019) and came back to Delhi after 14 years (after 2005). Now that I look back, there are certain observations that worry me about Delhi - Gurgaon culture. Listing them down here :
Overt celebration of¬†eat-sleep-repeat¬†culture : The common phrase that I hear most people use is : ‚Äú I don‚Äôt want to think too much and just chill‚Äù.</description>

      <description>People are just either not that interested in what you&amp;rsquo;re saying, or they are too focused on their own agenda. It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous to see two people acting like they can‚Äôt really hear each other ‚Äî by choice.
In &amp;ldquo;The Significance Principle,&amp;rdquo; authors Les Carter and Jim Underwood posit that we should listen past where the other person has finished. We should even pause before answering. Let them get their point, their story, their compliment, and even their criticism out.</description>
