      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently revisited one of my favorite books: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.in/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/0241003709&#34;&gt;How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big&lt;/a&gt; that profoundly shaped my worldview back in 2016. Reading it again with a few more years of experience under my belt, I found myself coming across insights I had completely missed the first time around. I strongly recommend reading it. But if you’re short on time, I’ve shared my notes below, written as lifelong advice to myself, and hopefully valuable to you too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
