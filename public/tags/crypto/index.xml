      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Hyperliquid long before it went mainstream. I bought HYPE on day one of its TGE, though I ended up missing the airdrop. It’s easily one of the best-designed perps platforms out there generating over a billion dollars in revenue with just an 11-member team. I’ve been using it for over a year now and genuinely believe it will bring perpetuals into the mainstream. The HYPE token (native to HYPE EVM) also has consistent buy pressure from the Assistant Fund, which makes me incredibly bullish on its long-term value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
