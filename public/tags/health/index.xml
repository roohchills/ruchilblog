      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Sept. 2023, I’ve been putting a lot more focus on my health especially working out regularly and walking consistently. This is quite the contrast from 2020, when I’d down a couple of Red Bulls a day while grinding through crazy working hours. I’m back to one Red Bull a day now and working on cutting it out completely. Still, I’m proud of how far I’ve come in building discipline around my health. Check out the charts below. I’ll check back in around this time next year and see if I’ve kept the momentum going. On average, I’ve been walking more 10 kms a day and burning over 1,000 calories/day. My resting heart rate has also improved since July (it had spiked for a bit due to some unforeseen circumstances). But tomorrow’s a new day. Bring it on!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
