      <description>&lt;p&gt;US stocks are at an all-time high, and a comparison between Big Tech P/E ratios and the S&amp;amp;P 500 does indicate that stocks might be overvalued. Both Warren Buffett and Michael Burry have started reallocating their investments from US markets to Chinese and other markets. While I&amp;rsquo;m still evaluating new positions, I&amp;rsquo;ve already started reducing my exposure to US stocks, Indian small and mid-cap stocks, which appear significantly overvalued relative to the broader index.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
