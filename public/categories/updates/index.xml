      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to share the best of what I read each month through my previous posts. While it helped me to push myself write a post each month, it was coming in the way of meditating on what I read. I will try to write (reming me if I don’t) a post on what meditation on what you’ve read means, but it definitely does not mean completing your reading backlog for the sake of it. I will be pausing these monthly posts, and will instead try to share a list of interesting reads once I have meditated over them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on migrating and enhancing my blog’s theme and will not be posting for sometime. I intent to start posting again next year and port all the previous posts as soon as the new theme design and migration is done. Till then, you can reach out to me on Twitter(pinned above) DM. Have a great year ahead! 🤝&lt;/p&gt;</description>
