      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to share the best of what I read each month through my previous posts. While it helped me to push myself write a post each month, it was coming in the way of meditating on what I read. I will try to write (reming me if I don’t) a post on what meditation on what you’ve read means, but it definitely does not mean completing your reading backlog for the sake of it. I will be pausing these monthly posts, and will instead try to share a list of interesting reads once I have meditated over them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
