      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently tried out the Perplexity app and was quite impressed with the results. While Iâ€™ve not spent enough time to come to a conclusion yet, what really delighted me was the time it took to answer my question. Searching through Perplextiy felt like speaking to a friend who knows what exactly you are looking for and spoon feeding the response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I searched for &lt;em&gt;how should I select an uploaded image on Notability&lt;/em&gt; inside Perplexity &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt;. Without clicking a single link, Perplexity walked me through the image selection process whereas Google showed an answer to a different question altogether. Perplexity not only understood this simple question correctly, it shared a step by step process to resolve my query instead of an incorrect response as a summary. See screenshots below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
