      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I used to introduce myself as someone who didn&amp;rsquo;t write code. Well, things have changed! With the rise of AI, especially since the introduction of ChatGPT, I am absolutely amazed by the capabilities of AI in assisting me with coding and building projects. I had a strong desire to create my own website after successfully launching one using Jekyll in 2020, but I was struggling with customizing it to my liking. Scouring through endless Google search results was not only time-consuming but also incredibly frustrating. This led me to postpone working on my blog post, repeatedly putting it off until I had enough time to dedicate to it. But with the advent of ChatGPT, I came to a realization â€“ I didn&amp;rsquo;t need more time; I simply needed to ask questions, and it would provide me with the precise answers I required to customize my blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
