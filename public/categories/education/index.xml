      <description>If a cool blogpost template is stopping you from writing more, the problem is most definitely not that cool template. Writing more requires writing a lot in the initial phases. Same goes with writing well. It&amp;rsquo;s about turning on your mental faucet to let the ideas flow freely, which in turn, leads to quality content. If you really think a cool blog website will help you cross your motivation barrier and push you to start writing more, then maybe this post can help.</description>
